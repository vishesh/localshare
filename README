A simple HTTP Server to serve files in given directory. If you have Python
installed "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" would do the same. However in many
cases you dont have Python installed but definitely Java, where this might help.
eg. My College. They dont have Python installed, and very often I need something
like this.

This is very basic untested, no-robust implementation.
